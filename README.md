About Me
Hello! I'm Nithes Kumar S, a passionate and driven 20-year-old full-stack web developer with experience in building dynamic web applications. I recently completed an internship at Codenatives, a digital technology company specializing in web and mobile app development, where I honed my skills in real-time web applications and gained hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development.

During my internship, I worked on various projects, including a full-stack restaurant website where I implemented features like user authentication, menu management, and real-time payment integration. My technical skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, MySQL, and Django. Additionally, I have a background in machine learning, having interned at Technohacks, where I built predictive models for heart disease, wine quality, and diabetes.

I'm dedicated to continuous learning and improvement, always seeking new challenges to enhance my coding and problem-solving abilities. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the latest trends in technology and contributing to open-source projects.
